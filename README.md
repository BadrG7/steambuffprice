### ABOUT
My buff project will allow users to find the accurate price (in buff.163.com) of their whole steam inventory at once.  

### Why do I need this?
Sadly, when you open buff's inventory feature, the total price it gives you is inaccurate, showing you only the steam
market price.  

For example :

<img align="left" alt="example1" src="https://github.com/xFumbler/steambuffprice/blob/master/images/example1.png?raw=true)"> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


When in reality this is the true cost of your item :
<img align="left" alt="example1" src="https://github.com/xFumbler/steambuffprice/blob/master/images/example2.png?raw=true)"> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Requirements :

Since BUFF has made it nearly impossible to find items prices without having an account,
this script will require the session cookie linked to your account.

How to find your session cookie
<br/>

To access the cookie, go to buff and right click and press "inspect", <br/> after you do so open
Network > All, then refresh the page, once that is done,<br/> go to the first item,
should be something like "goods?goods_id=XXXXX".. <br/>
Click on the item and go to Headers, and scroll down to "Request Headers", once you find that
click on "Cookie", and copy its contents, and your done!
<br/>

STEAM ID

Providing the STEAMID will allow the scraper to see all of your csgo items. <br/>
To find the STEAMID, it is very simple. Copy your profile link, and go to:https://steamid.xyz/ 
Once you are there, paste the profile link and you should see this.
